# How software can save your life

Short description (for the conference website):
Currently, healthcare is getting better and better all around the world. But, when one of the most important mans in the world (Steve Jobs) 
dies from a disease like cancer, that we have been studying for a long time, we see how much we have to improve in this field. In this talk,
I'll introduce the audience to some health challenges, and show how we can build technology that will help doctors to build a better world.


Full Description (for the organizers):

In this talk, I'll introduce the audience to a new world that isn't so explored in the tech field, health informatics. 
I'll talk about the current health challenges that we have around the world, show some awesome initiatives that combine health and computer science
and try to convince people to build software and companies to solve this health problems, in order to build a better world.

The talk will be splitted in three parts:

1) Introduce the problems and challenges on the health field. (Why you should care about health problems)
2) Show the current solutions. (Talk about some awesome inovations in the field)
3) Try to convince people to care and work more on HealthCare solutions. (Show how big is the market available and how they could start solving health problems)

Besides this, I'll talk about my experience of building an iPhone application to automate melanoma diagnosis.

Also, the talk is inspired by this talk by Steve Yegge (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKmQW_Nkfk8).

PS: This talk isn't focused on Ruby, it's a more general talk about the whole software field.
